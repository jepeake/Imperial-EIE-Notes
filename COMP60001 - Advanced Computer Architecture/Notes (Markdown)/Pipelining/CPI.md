***CPI***

***CPI Examples***

***Single-Cycle:***
- *single-cycle unpipelined machine has long critical path → **long cycle time***
- *takes 1 cycle for every instruction → **CPI 1***

<br>

***Pipelining:***
- *pipelined also has **CPI of 1 & much lower cycle time** (as can overlap instructions - critical path of single pipeline stage shorter → between pipeline latches rather than entire path)*
- *much faster execution of 3 instructions*
