***Instruction Level Parallelism***

- - - 

1. ***Pipelining**: This is one of the most basic forms of ILP, where different stages of multiple instructions are processed at the same time in different parts of the processor. For example, while one instruction is being decoded, another can be executed, and a third can be fetched from memory.*
    
2. ***Superscalar Execution**: This involves a processor that can issue multiple instructions per clock cycle. It requires multiple execution units (like ALUs, FPUs, etc.) and often complex logic to handle dependencies and resource conflicts.*
    
3. ***Out-of-Order Execution**: This technique allows the processor to execute instructions as resources become available, rather than strictly following the original program order. This helps to minimize idle time in the execution units.*
    
4. ***Speculative Execution**: In this method, the processor guesses the outcome of a branch (like an 'if' statement) and starts executing instructions along the predicted path. If the guess is wrong, the speculatively executed instructions are discarded.*
    
5. ***VLIW (Very Long Instruction Word) and EPIC (Explicitly Parallel Instruction Computing)**: These are related approaches where the compiler, rather than the processor, plays a critical role in identifying parallelism. They bundle instructions that can be executed in parallel into a single, long instruction word.*
    
6. ***SIMD (Single Instruction, Multiple Data)**: This is a form of parallelism where one instruction is executed simultaneously on multiple data points. This is common in vector processors and GPUs.*
    
7. ***Hyper-Threading (Simultaneous Multi-Threading)**: This Intel technology allows a single processor core to behave like multiple logical cores, thereby handling multiple threads simultaneously.*
